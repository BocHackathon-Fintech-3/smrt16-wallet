These contracts provide us cheaper, faster way for business and individuals to get access to the all variety of financial services. And most importantly, all this is absolutely consistent with the laws of Cyprus today.<br class="inline">What kind of dApplications we are talking about? Let&#39;s speak about some use cases. </p><p>The most simple case which first comes to mind: you will be able to create/update/close a contract with your Electricity company. And/or other <strong>communal payments</strong> can be managed and payed of course.<br class="inline">The second case is sing up for life/car/house <strong>insurances</strong> and again pay for your regular bills.</p><p>Another case is that there can be loan oriented dApps, which will perform <strong>lending</strong> and even serve <strong>mortgage</strong> projects.<br class="inline">Of course through the dApps browser user will be able to have access to electronic money based on stable coins/ethereum tokens together with some investment tools and securities. So, this way the smart app opens a big door to the world of wealth management present over the blockchain.</p><figure><img src="https://telegra.ph/file/6951506d5bb1c7fa00919.jpg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><br></p></article>
